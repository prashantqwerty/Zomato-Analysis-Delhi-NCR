# Zomato-Analysis-Delhi-NCR
I have analysed Zomato's Delhi NCR data into 4 points which every person willing to start a cloud kitchen or offline dining restaurants should know as it tells about the location, pricing, food , cuisine type of the top 100 restaurants out of >10k restaurants (based on dining rating for offline and delivery rating for online).I have used geocoding, descriptive statistics, text analysis and have converted all that into a single rmarkdown file .
I have only put up the rmd file cause flexdashboard aint working well on laptop but gonna update it soon.
